# COMP3005 Assignment 3
### By Max Sobota
Application which connects to a PostgreSQL to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

I chose Python as my language of choice to keep things simple, as there are many available libraries to use which make connections to a PostgreSQL database.
I'm running Python version 3.???.???, and the latest pgAdmin 4 update.

I used the psycopg2 package for my implementation, to install using pip, run the command "pip install psycopg2". 
The library can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/

I'm using a 255 character limit for the strings as we've previously used in our SQL assignments.
